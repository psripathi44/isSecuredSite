# isSecuredSite

isSecuredSite was a small application I developed as per the request of the network team who would want to verify if a particular URL is Secured or not.

Input: CSV File<br/>
Output: Count of secured URLs and the list of URLs with an option to download in EXCEL or PDF format.

The application will take your file as input and produce the results on the screen.
